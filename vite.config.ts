 * cytoscape/cytoscape-web#642.
 *
 * It contains the BROWSER publish set, not the whole of dist/. Three things in
 * dist/ have no business on a public store and are excluded deliberately:
 *
 *   - `mf-manifest.json` embeds absolute build-machine paths (your home
 *     directory and username) in `configuredRuntimePlugins`.
 *   - `mf-stats.json` is build metadata nothing fetches at runtime.
 *   - the SSR entry, loader and module-runner are ~34 kB of Node-only code
 *     guarded by `typeof window === 'undefined'` — unreachable in a browser.
 *
 * This is the same set the repository publishes to GitHub Pages, so what the
 * store serves matches what the examples site serves.
 *
 * An ALLOWLIST, and an unmatched file fails the build: a future plugin version
 * must not be able to slip a new file class into a public upload by default.
 *
 * The zip is written OUTSIDE dist/ on purpose. A zip inside dist/ would be
 * swept into the next one, and the repository's copy-dist rejects any file its
 * own publish classes do not name.
