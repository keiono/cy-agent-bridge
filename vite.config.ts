// subpath import silently bundles MUI locally instead — the plugin matches
// share keys exactly, and MUI is not in its COMMON_SHARED_SUBPATHS list. The
// trailing-slash key is NOT the fix: it materializes a share entry per subpath
// actually referenced, and the runtime looks providers up by exact key, so a
// subpath resolves only if the HOST imports it too. `npm run check:imports`
// bans the subpath form; `noSharedPayload` below catches it if the lint is
// bypassed. `@mui/icons-material` is banned outright — the host does not share
// it, and one icon pulls in SvgIcon plus the Emotion engine behind it.
//
// `import: false` — do NOT bundle a local fallback. Those fallbacks are
// STATICALLY imported by the exposed module, so they cost transfer and parse
// time on every load even when the host's singleton is the instance used.

// runtime takes the first registered provider with no semver comparison.
